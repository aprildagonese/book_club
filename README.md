## DTR: Define the Relationship
Group Member Names: Rene Casco and April Dagonese

Goals and Expectations for the Project (What does each group member hope to get out of this project? What do we want to achieve as a team? How will we know that we're successful?):
- Learn as much as possible
- Complete the required functionality (earn a 3 for each category)

Team strengths & collaboration styles (consider discussing your Pairin qualities here):
- Rene is detail oriented and enjoys working as part of a team; prefers back-end work but is eager to learn more front-end; an open communicator
- April needs some solo time to fully process new ideas but enjoys working in a partnership once she feels comfortable with the material--a good mix of pairing time and solo time is preferable; enjoys both front-end and back-end work; also an open communicator and super eager to work through any disagreements openly

Schedule Expectations (When are we available to work together and individually? What constraints do we have?):
- We'll aim to stay at Turing until around 6-6:30pm when we need to complete work and adjust as necessary

Communication Expectations (How and often will we communicate? How do we keep lines of communication open? How will we make decisions as a team?):
- Slack is available at any time, and we'll both respond as quickly as we're able to

Abilities & Growth Expectations (Technical strengths and areas for desired improvement):
- Both eager to learn as much as possible, with no specific areas for desired improvement

Workload Expectations (What features do we each want to work on?):

Workflow Expectations (Git workflow/Tools/Code Review/Reviewing Pull Requests/Debugging and Problem-solving Techniques):
- Neither of us will merge our own commits; each of us with tag the other in a PR, and once approved, the partner will merge the commit

Expectations for giving and receiving feedback:
